Hi! I am Wenxin, a PhD student at Columbia Business School in the Decision, Risk, and Operations division. I am advised by [Santiago R. Balseiro](https://www.columbia.edu/~srb2155/) and [Will Ma](https://www.columbia.edu/~wm2428/). 

I am broadly interested in online algorithms for resource allocation, with a focus on applications in pricing, revenue management, and general service systems. In the summer of 2024, I was a student researcher at Google Research, where I worked on developing load balancing algorithms.

Previously, I obtained my BE in Industrial Engineering from Tsinghua University, with a minor in Data Science and Technology.
